# Description

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict housing prices in California using the California housing dataset. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses based on various features, such as location, number of rooms, and income levels.

# Overview

The California Housing Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project inspired by the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow." The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes features such as median house price, population, and median income. By implementing the techniques and methodologies outlined in the book, this project aims to create an accurate predictive model for real estate pricing in California, making it a valuable resource for understanding and forecasting housing market trends in the region.
